# # Honey Production Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Summary:
This project aims to analyze and predict honey production trends in the United States using real-world data. The dataset contains historical records of honey production, including various metrics like yield, production value, and total production per year. By applying linear regression, this project explores the decline in honey production over time and predicts future trends, focusing specifically on projecting honey production for the year 2050.

The goal of this project was to learn and apply the fundamentals of **linear regression** and data manipulation using **Pandas** and **NumPy**, along with data visualization using **Matplotlib**. The project involved cleaning and processing the data, fitting a linear regression model to understand the relationship between year and total honey production, and making future predictions.

## Key Steps:
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:  
   The dataset was loaded and the relevant columns were explored to understand the structure and content of the data. The focus was placed on the total honey production (`totalprod`) per year.

2. **Linear Regression Model**:  
   Using **scikit-learn**, a linear regression model was created to find the relationship between the year and honey production. The model's slope and intercept were analyzed to understand the decline in honey production.

3. **Data Visualization**:  
   Visualizations were created using **Matplotlib** to plot the scatter plot of historical honey production against years and overlay the linear regression line. Future predictions were also plotted to visualize the decline trend extending to the year 2050.

4. **Prediction for 2050**:  
   Based on the trained model, the future honey production was predicted for the year 2050, indicating the potential impact of ongoing trends in honey production.

## Skills and Technologies Used:
- **Pandas**: Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation
- **NumPy**: Data handling and array manipulation
- **scikit-learn**: Implementing linear regression
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization and plotting
- **Linear Regression**: Understanding and applying regression models for trend analysis and prediction

## Outcome:
The model successfully identified a declining trend in honey production over the years. The projection for the year 2050 indicated a further decrease in production based on past data, raising concerns about the future of honey production.

## Future Work:
- Enhance the model by including more features, such as weather data, to improve the accuracy of predictions.
- Use more sophisticated regression models (e.g., polynomial regression) if the relationship between year and production isn't perfectly linear.
- Explore other prediction techniques, such as time series forecasting.
